**How**:

## Data: 


## Strategies Used: 
* Employed white space in both my Plotly dash and presentation. 
* Margins remain free of text and visuals. 
* Visuals are not stretched to take up the available space; instead, appropriately sized to my content. 	
* The only thing on the page; a single sentence or even a single number. 
* All text in the visual is the same size except where decisions were made to further emphasize or de‚Äêemphasize components. 
* The graph title is larger.
