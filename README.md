## Region:
My data dashboard provides an insightful analysis of the current economic landscape of the housing market in Santa Barbara County. Designed for individuals navigating major life transitions—such as graduating, job searching, or relocating—this tool offers valuable data to help users assess housing affordability and make informed decisions about living in Santa Barbara.

## Datasets:
The first dataset provides insights into the distribution of jobs in Santa Barbara by industry, along with their associated wages. This data helps analyze which industries dominate the local job market and how wages vary across sectors.

The second dataset tracks the progression of median earnings over time, segmented by industry and gender. This dataset is crucial for understanding wage trends, gender disparities, and how an individual's earnings compare to industry averages.

Both datasets were selected to offer a comprehensive view of employment patterns, wage distribution, and income inequality in Santa Barbara, facilitating a deeper analysis of economic trends and workforce dynamics.

## Data: 
**CSV File in Root Directory**: 
* assets/Occupational employment and wages by major occupational group.csv
* assets/Median Earnings by Industry.csv

**CSV File Used for Data Visualization**: 
* https://www.bls.gov/regions/west/news-release/occupationalemploymentandwages_santabarbara.htm#TableA
* https://datausa.io/profile/geo/santa-barbara-ca/?monthly-employment=latestEmploymentValue

## Strategies Used: 
* Employed white space in both my Plotly dash and presentation. 
* Margins remain free of text and visuals. 
* Visuals are not stretched to take up the available space; instead, appropriately sized to my content. 	
* The only thing on the page; a single sentence or even a single number. 
* All text in the visual is the same size except where decisions were made to further emphasize or de‐emphasize components. 
* The graph title is larger.
